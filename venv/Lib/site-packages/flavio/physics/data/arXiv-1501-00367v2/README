The fit results included in these files are described in detail in the
corresponding submission, arXiv:1501.00367v2.

Filenames are in the following format: {ffset}_{decay}_{data}.d

ffset =   
	av : fits to V, A_0, A_1, and A_{12}
	 t : fits to T_1, T_2, and T_{23}

decay = 
        sl : active strange, spectator light (B to K*)
        ss : active strange, spectator strange (Bs to phi)
        ls : active light, spectator strange (Bs to K*)

data =
        results : each line contains a fit parameter and its central value
	covariance : for each pair of fit parameters, the covariance matrix
        	     element is given
	corrmat : correlation matrix elements constructed from the covariance 
		  matrix
