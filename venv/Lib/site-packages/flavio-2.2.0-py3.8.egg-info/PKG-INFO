        # flavio – flavour phenomenology in the Standard model and beyond
        
        flavio is a Python package to compute observables in flavour physics, electroweak precision tests, Higgs physics,
        and other precision tests of the Standard Model, both in
        the Standard Model and in the presence of new physics encoded in Wilson
        coefficients of dimension-6 operators.
